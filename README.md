# The Movies Catalogue
RTX3070 proudly presents his first Website/Web app...call it as you like the most.

The Movies Catalogue is a little project based on the TMDb API that let you browse movies and watch trailers based on your nationality (DE, ES, FR, IT, RU, US) and sort movies by popularity, rating, newest and oldest releases as well.

Hope you like it! : )
